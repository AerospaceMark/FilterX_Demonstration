# FilterX_Demonstration

This code was created as part of a class project at Brigham Young University. The class was PHSCS 662, an acoustics class where we learned about active noise control and were taught by Dr. Scott Sommerfeldt. Upon completion of this code, I was really pleased with how well it worked and decided to move it out of my class repository (which is kept private) and make it so others can see and use it.

Enjoy!
